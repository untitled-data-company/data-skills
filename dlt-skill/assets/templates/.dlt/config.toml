# dlt Configuration File
#
# This file contains non-sensitive configuration for your dlt pipeline.
# Add sensitive credentials to secrets.toml instead.
#
# Configuration hierarchy:
# [sources.<source_name>] - Source-specific configuration
# [destination.<destination_name>] - Destination-specific configuration
# [extract/normalize/load] - Pipeline stage configuration
# [runtime] - Runtime configuration

# Example: Source configuration
# [sources.my_source]
# base_url = "https://api.example.com/v1"
# timeout = 30
# batch_size = 100

# Example: Destination configuration
# [destination.bigquery]
# location = "US"
# project_id = "my-project"

# [destination.duckdb]
# credentials = "data/database.duckdb"  # Just the file path, no authentication needed

# [destination.snowflake]
# database = "ANALYTICS"
# warehouse = "COMPUTE_WH"
# role = "LOADER"

# Example: Performance tuning
# [extract]
# workers = 10
# max_parallel_items = 50

# [normalize]
# workers = 4

# [load]
# workers = 20

# Example: Data writer configuration
# [data_writer]
# buffer_max_items = 5000
# file_max_items = 100000

# Example: Runtime configuration
# [runtime]
# log_level = "INFO"
# data_dir = "/path/to/data/directory"
